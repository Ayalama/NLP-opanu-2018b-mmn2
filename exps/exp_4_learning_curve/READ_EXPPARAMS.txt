############## Additional info ###########
* run learning_curve.python script
* executing on hmm model with unknown words smoothing (tagged file under hmm_tagger_run3 folder)

############## params ###########
execution command: "python src/learning_curve.py 2 exps\exp_4_hmm_tagger\heb-pos.train exps\exp_4_hmm_tagger\heb-pos.test exps\exp_4_hmm_tagger\heb-pos.gold"

model = 2
train_file = exps\exp_4_hmm_tagger\heb-pos.train
test_file = exps\exp_4_hmm_tagger\heb-pos.test
gold_file = exps\exp_4_hmm_tagger\heb-pos.gold

############### outputs ##########
* training_set_folds- folder contain split of train_file into 10 parts
* training_files- contain the file for the model to train on in each iteraion. itr 1: file part 1. itr 2: file part 1+2 and so on...
* tagged_files- model *.tagged output according to relevant trainig file for iteraion
